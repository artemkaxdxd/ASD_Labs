There are two options for this lab (**Laba1_2.c, Laba1_2.c**):

1. Using relational operators (logical operators not allowed);
2. Logical operators required.

## Second Lab work
**For a given n, solve the equation.**

There are two options for this lab (**way1, way2**):

1. Solve the equation using nested loops;
2. Solve the equation using dynamic programming;

## Third Lab work
